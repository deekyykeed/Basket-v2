# 🚀 Supabase Setup Instructions for Basket v2

## Step 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign in or create a new account
3. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
4. Once the project is ready, go to **Settings** (gear icon) → **API**
5. Copy these two values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://abcdefgh.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

## Step 2: Update Your Supabase Configuration

1. Open `/lib/supabase.js`
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```javascript
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://your-actual-project.supabase.co';  // ← Paste your URL here
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'; // ← Paste your key here
```

**Important:** Keep the quotes ('') around the values!

## Step 3: Create Database Tables

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
2. Click **New Query**
3. Open the file `supabase-setup.sql` in this project
4. Copy ALL the SQL code from that file
5. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
7. Wait for "Success. No rows returned" message

## Step 4: Verify the Setup

### Check Tables Were Created:
1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase dashboard
2. You should see two tables:
   - ✅ `categories` (5 rows)
   - ✅ `products` (8 rows)

### Test a Query:
In the SQL Editor, run:
```sql
SELECT * FROM categories;
```
You should see: Grocery, Restaurants, Alcohol, Express, Retail

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE featured = true;
```
You should see 8 products (Tomato, Lettuce, Banana, etc.)

## Step 5: (Optional) Set Up Storage for Product Images

If you want to upload your own product images:

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase dashboard
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Name it: `product-images`
4. Make it **Public bucket** (check the box)
5. Click **Create bucket**

### Upload Images:
1. Click on the `product-images` bucket
2. Click **Upload files**
3. Upload your product images (PNG, JPG, WebP)
4. Copy the public URL of each image
5. Update product image URLs in the database

## Step 6: Test in Your App

Once everything is set up:

```bash
# Make sure dependencies are installed
npm install

# Start the development server
npx expo start
```

The app will now fetch real data from Supabase instead of using mock data!

## 📊 Database Schema Overview

### Categories Table
- `id` - UUID (Primary Key)
- `name` - Category name (e.g., "Grocery")
- `icon` - Emoji icon (e.g., "🛒")
- `slug` - URL-friendly name (e.g., "grocery")
- `display_order` - Order to display categories
- `is_active` - Show/hide category
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Auto-updated timestamp

### Products Table
- `id` - UUID (Primary Key)
- `name` - Product name (e.g., "Tomato")
- `description` - Product description
- `price` - Product price (decimal)
- `quantity_label` - Display label (e.g., "x5", "Bunch of 5")
- `image_url` - Product image URL
- `category_id` - Foreign key to categories
- `stock_quantity` - Available stock
- `is_available` - In stock or not
- `featured` - Show in "Fresh Finds"

## 🔒 Security (Row Level Security)

Both tables have RLS enabled with public read access:
- Anyone can **read** categories and products
- Only authenticated users (when you add auth) can **modify** data

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Invalid URL"
- Make sure your URL starts with `https://` and ends with `.supabase.co`
- Check that you wrapped it in quotes ('')

### Error: "Invalid API Key"
- Make sure you copied the **anon key**, not the service_role key
- Check that you wrapped it in quotes ('')
- The key should start with `eyJ`

### No Data Showing in App
- Verify tables exist in Table Editor
- Check that products have `is_available = true` and `featured = true`
- Look at console/terminal for error messages

### Images Not Loading
- Make sure image URLs are publicly accessible
- Test image URLs in a browser first
- Consider using Supabase Storage (Step 5)
